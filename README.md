## Overview

### The challenge

The above challenge is to display a total score in a colored part and the results in each test unit.
A button is set at the screen bottom to continue to a different part of the app. The button has three states: regular, hover and active.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After learning HTML5 and CSS3 my major challenges where:

- When to use grid or when to use flex?
- Grouping
- padding, merge

This challenge was really good for me to get a good understanding for the above.

### Continued development

My big goal is to going from simple HTML and CSS to build react and gatsby based webapps.
